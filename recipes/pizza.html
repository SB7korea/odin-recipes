    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This month, Pizza Hut is launching its mass-market take on Detroit style
      pizza, making it the first time that a pizza chain of its size is bringing
      Michigan's cheesy, saucy export nationwide. Their rectangular pies will be
      divided into four unique product offerings: Double Detroit Pepperoni,
      which loads up each pie with 80 pepperoni slices, Double Cheesy, Meaty
      Deluxe, and the Italian sausage, red onions, and green bell peppers of the
      Supremo pie.
    </p>

      So what sets Detroit-style pizza apart? A few things. First, there's the
      square or rectangular slices, made from dough that crisps up on the edges
      without getting too crunchy underneath. Deeper-dish than your average
      pizza (though not on Chicago's casserole-like level), each piece is loaded
      with cheese from edge to edge (for on-crust caramelization), and, most
      distinctively, finished off with a tomato sauce that goes on top.
