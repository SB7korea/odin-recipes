    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pepperoni is an American variety of spicy salami made from cured pork and
      beef seasoned with paprika or other chili pepper. Prior to cooking,
      pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly smoky, and bright red.
      Thinly sliced pepperoni is one of the most popular pizza toppings in
      American pizzerias.

    <p>
      Pepperoni, an Italian-American creation, is a cured dry sausage, with
      similarities to the spicy salamis of southern Italy on which it is based,
      such as salsiccia or soppressata. The main differences are that pepperoni
      is less spicy, has a finer grain (akin to spiceless salami from Milan), is
      usually softer in texture, and is usually produced with the use of an
      artificial casing.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2(12ounce) can Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>dough</li>
      <li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch
        pizza pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic
        powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until
        smooth. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large
        bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.
        Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky
        dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and
        elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise
        yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of
        dough onto the prepared pizza pans.
      </li>
      <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is
        bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
        oven racks halfway through baking.
      </li>
    </ol>
