      Description
      <p>
        The main reason the Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger remains a popular burger
        in the Sooner State and throughout the U.S. is because it’s so simple,
        yet so delicious. It’s made with typical household ingredients and there
        aren’t any bells and whistles—but the technique takes those basic
        ingredients to a new flavor level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frying the onions on the grill gives them a caramelized taste and
        slightly crispy texture while smashing the burgers allows the Maillard
        reaction to take effect. The Maillard reaction browns the meat and gives
        it a deep savory flavor that is good enough to eat on its own without
        any condiments.
