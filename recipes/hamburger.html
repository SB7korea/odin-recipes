    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Smashing ground beef firmly into an ungreased pan increases contact
      points, delivering maximum crust and maximum flavor. We use a stiff
      spatula or a bench scraper to scrape the burger up from the pan, making
      sure to get every last bit of tasty brown crust. By cooking two 2-ounce
      patties instead of one 4-ounce patty, we get double the amount of crust,
      while a slice of cheese in between the patties keeps things moist.
